# Data-Science-Assignment-1-
This repository contains the solution for the Sampling Assignment, which focuses on handling highly imbalanced datasets and studying the impact of different sampling techniques on machine learning model performance.

## Problem Overview
* A highly imbalanced credit card dataset is used.
* The dataset is first converted into a balanced class dataset.
* Five different samples are created.
* Five sampling techniques are applied to five different machine learning models.
* Model accuracies are compared to determine which sampling technique performs best for each model.


# Tasks Performed
* Dataset loading and preprocessing
* Class balancing of imbalanced data
* Creation of multiple samples
* Application of multiple sampling techniques
* Training and evaluation of multiple ML models
* Comparative analysis of accuracy results
